Looking into [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)! :metal:
=======================

I've worked with Unity and dipped my toe into Unreal.

I wanted something I could use to quickly prototype ideas. Something with minimal setup requirements and the shortest path-to-output possible. After researching things quite a bit I settled on [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

### Why?

I :heart: javascript. A lot.

I also :heart: the idea of running full-fledged, high performance 3D code in a browser without the need for any plugins.

WebGL is the way to go for super performant 3D in a browser, and Babylon.js seems a good choice for working with WebGL.

Structure
=========

### Tasks

To get the best bang for your learning buck, I'd recommend looking through the [Project Tasks](https://github.com/MayBGames/babbling-on/projects/1). The Tasks (_Cards in GitHub parlance_) in the **Done** column are sorted in newest-to-oldest completion order.

### Commits

Pretty much every [commit](https://github.com/MayBGames/babbling-on/commits/master) has valuable details regarding what was done and why. Many commits are linked to Tasks as well (_though not all - sometimes I fuck up_), making it clear what work is attached to what feature/bugfix/chore.

### Commit diff comments

I'd recommend :star:ing this repo and checking back often as I'm going through and adding comments to specific lines of code in commit diffs. My goal here is to expand upon the explanations in the commit messages; adding details about why I did things the way I did, general project structure suggestions, and random thoughts as close to the code as possible without adding comments to source files.

Feedback/Contributions
======================

I'd love to hear what you think - good or bad! Feel free to comment on open issues, open your own issues, fork the repo, make changes you'd like to see, and send pull requests!

Thanks, and I hope this repo helps you wrap your head around [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)! :metal:
