TEST ALL THE BABYLON.JS
=======================

I've worked with Unity and dipped my toe into Unreal.

I wanted something I could use to quickly prototype ideas. Something with minimal setup requirements and the shortest path-to-output possible. After researching things quite a bit I settled on Babylon.js.

### Why?

I :heart: javascript. A lot.

I also :heart: the idea of running full-fledged, high performance 3D code in a browser without the need for any plugins.

WebGL is the way to go for super performant 3D in a browser, and Babylon.js seems to a good choice for working with WebGL.

Current state
-------------

I got a very basic WASD-style control scheme working for a little cylindar on a plane.

I think a good next step would be to add some blocks to the plane for reference (so we can tell when Cyli VonDerface moves around).

I'm also thinking some sort of mesh loader will also happen soon. Maybe I can abstract that out into it's own module.

We'll see...
