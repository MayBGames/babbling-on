TEST ALL THE BABYLON.JS
=======================

I've worked with Unity and dipped my toe into Unreal.

I wanted something I could use to quickly prototype ideas. Something with minimal setup requirements and the shortest path-to-output possible. After researching things quite a bit I settled on Babylon.js.

### Why?

I :heart: javascript. A lot.

I also :heart: the idea of running full-fledged, high performance 3D code in a browser without the need for any plugins.

WebGL is the way to go for super performant 3D in a browser, and Babylon.js seems to a good choice for working with WebGL.
